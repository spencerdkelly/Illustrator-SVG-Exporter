and then attempts to export all the groupItems within that Group
into separate SVG files.
The SVG filenames are taken from the name of each layer group inside 
the Illustrator file along with an optional suffix that the user 
can add from the dialog prompt.

HOW TO USE: <br>

<li>If you don't see the script there try restarted Illustrator.</li>
</ul>
